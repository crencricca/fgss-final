# fgss-final

For this project, I interviewed three of my peers about their responses to samples of both ancient and modern fictional narratives. My research question focused around comparing and contrasting their initial reactions to the characters. I built a website to display the results of my preliminary study. 

This project was built using Vue.js and Vuetify.
