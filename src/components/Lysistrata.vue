          The Lysistrata is an example of an Ancient Greek comedy. Unlike Greek
          tragedy, comedy referenced current events instead of the mythic past.
          The Lysistrata was performed in 411 BCE, a massive war between the
          Greek poleis Athens and Sparta (and each of these major powers’
          allies) that had already been underway, on and off, for 20 years, and
          would continue for another seven. In Aristophanes’ play, the women of
          Greece, from both sides of the conflict, come together and decide to
          take matters into their own hands.

              We must give up the pleasure of-the prick. [Women shudder and
              start to leave.] What makes you turn away? Don't try to leave. You
              there, why grimace and shake your heads like that?
              [Melodramatically] 'What means this pale complexion, these tears
              that flow?' Well, will you or won't you do it? Please tell me
              that.

              I feel the same. The war must take its course.

            <p>
              <b>KALONIKE:</b>
              Ask anything, anything else. I'd be prepared To walk through fire.
              But not give up the prick! There's nothing like it, dear
              Lysistrata.

            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b>
              Well, what about you?

            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b>
              The female sex! Sheer lustfulness, that's us! No wonder they write
              such tragedies about us! Our lives are simply full of sex and
              intrigue.* [Pleadingly] But you, dear Spartan friend-if only you
              would stick with me, we'd save the situation. Please lend support.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>KALONIKE:</b> Suppose we really did abstain from it, though god
              forbid! What difference would it make To getting peace?
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b>
              A difference like no other. If we were to sit at home, our faces
              powdered, And wore short silken shifts to give a glimpse of nicely
              trimmed small triangles of hair, so our husbands started to swell
              and wanted to shag, But we held back and refused to let them do
              it-I tell you now: they'd make peace in a flash.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>LAMPITO:</b> It's true, when Menelaos caught a glimpse Of
              Helen's breasts, it made him drop his sword.

            <p>
              <b>KALONIKE:</b>

            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b>
              To borrow Pherekrates' phrase: try self-abuse!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>KALONIKE:</b>
              A useless substitute! It's just not real. And what if they turn
              quite rough, and drag us upstairs?
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b>
              Then grab the bedroom door and cling for life.
            </p>
            <p><b>KALONIKE:</b> But what if they beat us up?</p>
            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b>
              Keep on resisting. They can't derive much pleasure from forcing
              us. We've got to make them suffer in every way. They'll soon give
              in: no husband can enjoy A life of constant friction with his
              wife.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>KALONIKE:</b>
              Well, if you two agree, we'll go along.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>LAMPITO:</b> But how will we persuade our Spartan husbands To
              keep the peace without duplicitous guile? And who could hope to
              persuade the Athenian rabble to keep its mind fixed on
              negotiations?
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b> Don't worry, we'll soon convince our people
              here.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>LAMPITO:</b> Not while their triremes still having rigging
              intact, And your goddess's vault contains such limitless funds!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b> I've made provisions to cover this very point:
              We're going to seize the Akropolis today. This task has been
              assigned to older women: While we talk here, they're going to use
              the pretext of a sacrifice to occupy the hill.
            </p>
            <p><b>LAMPITO:</b> A perfect ploy-you've thought of everything.</p>
            <p>
              <b>LYSISTRATA:</b>
              In that case, Lampito, let's swear an oath at once, to make our
              pact unbreakable.

                        I find it extremely difficult to relate to any of the
                        women in this passage as I get distracted with how it is
                        entirely full of deprecation of women. Even the women
                        themselves are so deep in their own experience with
                        misogyny that they are solely talking about their
                        relations with their husbands and how this war affects
                        that.

                        Lysistrata is a woman who has the motivation to change
                        the lives of many men by using her gender in order to
                        seize the Acropolis and shorten the war.

                        seize the Acropolis. Since the women are seen as solely
                        sexual objects, nobody would expect them to do something
                        to impact the course of the war that the men have been
                        fighting.

                      <p class="body-2">
                        Yes, I would say the passage is a little bit funny. Not
                        in the way that makes you want to laugh out loud, but in
                        the way that it makes you recognize how sexualization of
                        women has and has not changed from all the way back when
                        this was written to present times. Nowadays, there is
                        very little that women are barred from, and women in the
                        military would not be shut down due to their use as a
                        sexual object. On the other hand, present times are
                        still terrible in the oversexualization of women. Women
                        are raped and then told that it is their fault for
                        provoking the men to act out in that way. This passage
                        is funny in the way that it brings these issues to
                        light, especially because one would think that this
                        would change after over 2400 years.

                        Lysistrata is a charismatic leader who’s not afraid to
                        speak up for what she wants. Sick of men messing
                        everything up, she finds a clever way to use her
                        sexuality to her advantage. She is smart and not afraid
                        of confrontation.

                        The women are using their status as sexual commodities

                        subjugated to the men’s wills, in this passage they
                        demand power by taking away from men the one thing they
                        cannot go without: sex. They also use the fact that the
                        rest of the population underestimates them to infiltrate
                        and occupy certain spaces.

                        Yes, I found it hilarious. The serious and earnest tone
                        contrasted with the more scandalous and outlandish
                        content in an unexpected but appreciated way. I
                        especially appreciated Lampito’s contribution about
                        Menelaos.

                        I have a hard time relating to the characters in this
                        passage. The situation is just so distant and foreign to
                        me that I cannot even really imagine myself in it. I
                        also feel that the majority of these women embody many
                        of the stereotypes associated with women, such as
                        hypersexuality and helplessness.

                        Lysistrata is really the only woman who defies these
                        stereotypes. She is clearly a very strong leader and
                        charismatic speaker, as she is able to convince the rest
                        of the women to agree with her mission. She is
                        determined to bring an end to the war the only way she
                        knows how, making her a resourceful character in my
                        opinion.

                        war in the household in retaliation to the ongoing war
                        between Athens and Sparta. They have also taken
                        advantage of older women’s status in society in order to
                        take over the Acropolis. To me, this an incredible
                        display of resourcefulness and strength – the women have
                        used the way that Greek society sexualizes them to their

                      <p class="body-2">
                        I find this passage somewhat funny. I laughed at the
                        wordplay and jokes that Aristophanes uses, but some of
                        the jokes are SO sexist. The foundation of the humor in
                        this text depends on stereotypes about women, and the
                        humor is seeing the women embody these stereotypes.
                        Especially knowing that the characters would have been
                        played by men, it seems like more of a mockery of women
                        than something that women would be inclined to laugh
                        along with.

                    In order to analyze this data, I focused on the responses to
                    the questions about Lysistrata's character. I took each of
                    the responses and removed the "filler" words that did not
                    carry significant meaning. I gathered a list of words that
                    the respondents used in association with or to directly
                    describe Lysistrata and put the list into a word cloud
                    generator.

                  <p class="body-2">
                    I then separated the words by sentiment and with the help of
                    a sentiment analysis program, labeled them as either
                    positive, negative, or neutral. I then made a simple pie
                    chart displaying the relative percentages of each.

                    It seems that readers struggled to connect more with

                    this text is so overtly sexist that it is difficult to look
                    past in order to make a connection with the characters.
