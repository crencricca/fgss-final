          Based on the best-selling novel by Margaret Atwood, this series is set
          in Gilead, a totalitarian society in what used to be part of the
          United States. Gilead is ruled by a fundamentalist regime that treats
          women as property of the state, and is faced with environmental
          disasters and a plummeting birth rate. In a desperate attempt to
          repopulate a devastated world, the few remaining fertile women are
          forced into sexual servitude. One of these women, Offred, is
          determined to survive the terrifying world she lives in, and find the
          daughter that was taken from her.

              We go everywhere in twos. This is supposed to be for our
              protection, but that’s bullshit. The truth is we’re watching each
              other for any whiff of heresy. She is my spy, as I am hers. She
              has never said anything that was not strictly orthodox. But then
              neither have I. She may be a true believer, a Handmaid in more
              than name. I can’t take that risk. I can’t end up on the Wall and
              leave my daughter here. Alone.

                        This passage is extremely interesting in the way that it
                        only shows the perspective of one of the women, Offred,
                        but features three women. We can hear Offred’s opinions
                        on her situation, specifically in the way that she
                        relates to Ofglen whose views are uncertain. I would be
                        very interested to see if all of the women had the same
                        perspective of Offred, but are hiding it in the same way
                        that she is.

                      <p class="body-2">
                        Offred is a woman who would do anything for her family.
                        She is playing the part of an orthodox Handmaid in order
                        to one day find her daughter and reunite her family. She
                        is a dedicated woman who put others before herself and
                        would sacrifice her own happiness for the good of
                        others.

                        I would characterize the interaction as extremely
                        scripted. This interaction seems like it would happen
                        between any two women in Gilead, as they are restricted
                        to say so few things to one another. It seems that this
                        conversation is one of the few that they are allowed to
                        have daily and therefore it is extremely mundane and
                        scripted.

                        Does it make a difference that this passage clearly was
                        written/takes place during modern times?
                      </p>
                      <p class="body-2">
                        The fact that this passage is written during modern
                        times is extremely strange as it seems to have been
                        written either in a futuristic time, or a very long time
                        ago. This is clearly not an interaction that women in
                        the current United States would have with one another
                        and there are many things that I believe will never
                        happen in the world, such as their names being Of the
                        man that they are given to. It seems impossible that
                        this would be considered a modern story.

                        she puts on a cordial, submissive facade in order to
                        glean information from her peers. Even though it is
                        supposed to mean “of Fred,” her same sounds similar to
                        “offered,” which is ironic because based on this passage
                        she would not appreciate being an offering.

                        Though the handmaids appear amicable with one another,
                        their every interaction is fraught with tension and
                        suspicion. Their constant references to a male power
                        figure (“His hand”, “praise be”) illustrate that their
                        conversations are not free -each person withholds
                        information, whether it be their true motivations or
                        details about current events. On multiple occasions a
                        character expresses overt suspicion in regards to
                        another character, despite their apparent closeness
                        (shopping together, mutual friends named Martha)

                        accustomed to today. In addition, the syntax seems more
                        familiar and the characters’ motivations are more
                        immediately apparent.

                        I think it this passage is really interesting because so
                        much of the conversation depends on subtext and is
                        unspoken. We only are given Offred’s perspective, which
                        serves to allow the audience to feel the same suspicion
                        and hesitation that Offred displays. This reminds me of
                        the conversation between Antigone and Ismene, where
                        Antigone tries to figure out where her sister’s
                        loyalties lie. It seems that Offred and the other women
                        in this scene are closely watching each other’s
                        reactions in an attempt to determine each other’s
                        loyalties.

                      <p class="body-2">
                        The main motivation behind Offred’s character seems to
                        be loyalty to her family. She seems to be utilizing
                        social survival skills to avoid arousing suspicion. She
                        is smart with her reactions and seems to be acutely
                        aware of her situation.

                      <p class="body-2">
                        I would characterize the interaction as very tense. The
                        women seem to be afraid to arouse suspicion with one
                        another, implying that there would be harsh consequences
                        for heresy. It is clear that none of the women are
                        acting naturally. However, despite the scripted nature
                        of their conversation, I think that there is more being
                        said than what is actually spoken.

                        It does make a difference – first, some of the language
                        is more colloquial and familiar to us as modern readers.
                        Hearing Offred’s internal thoughts makes her a very
                        relatable character, as I would likely act similarly if
                        I were in her situation. The story seems like it could
                        take place in the near future, which makes it easier as
                        a reader for me to imagine myself in it. The dystopian
                        feel of the story also feels familiar because it is
                        popular in fiction right now.

                    In order to analyze this data, I focused on the responses to
                    the questions about Offred's character. I took each of the
                    responses and removed the "filler" words that did not carry
                    significant meaning. I gathered a list of words that the
                    respondents used in association with or to directly describe
                    Offred and put the list into a word cloud generator.

                  <p class="body-2">
                    I then separated the words by sentiment and with the help of
                    a sentiment analysis program, labeled them as either
                    positive, negative, or neutral. I then made a simple pie

                    spread of the words used is the most varied across positive,
                    negative, and neutral that I have encountered so far. To me,
                    this signifies a more complex relationship with the
                    character. In a future study, I think it would be really
                    interesting to look more deeply into this idea about
                    complexity of relationship vs. connection.

                    I would hypothesize that Offred is in some ways easier to
                    relate to because she is a more modern character, but the
                    reading is very futuristic and dystopian which makes it more
                    difficult for the reader to relate. I think that this
                    implies that it is not just when the text was written that
                    influences the reader, but also when it takes place.
