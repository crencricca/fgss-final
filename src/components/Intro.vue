            <v-card-text>Throughout our study of female characters in Ancient Greek plays and stories, I found myself wondering how these characters would have been received by a contemporary Greek or Roman woman at the time. I mostly thought about how the often-negative portrayal of women in fictional narratives would have affected a female viewerâ€™s self-perception. Our self-identity is obviously a major factor in how we navigate society, and for younger women, fictional female characters were often the only other representation of women to look to for guidance. We have talked a lot about gender roles in this class, and one theme that has stuck out to me in particular is how stagnant these gender roles seemed to be in Ancient Greece. Further, it fascinates me how stagnant gender roles have seemed to be in general; I see similarities between gender roles in Ancient Greek society and today. I believe that part of the reason why this is the case is due to the portrayal of women in fictional narratives, leading to lack of strong role models. I think that the recent shifts in gender roles can partially be attributed to stronger female representation in media and fictional narratives.</v-card-text>
