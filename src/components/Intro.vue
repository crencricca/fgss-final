            <v-card-title>Introduction</v-card-title>
            <v-card-text>Throughout our study of female characters in Ancient Greek plays and stories, I found myself wondering how these characters would have been received by a contemporary Greek or Roman woman at the time. I mostly thought about how the often-negative portrayal of women in fictional narratives would have affected a female viewerâ€™s self-perception. Our self-identity is obviously a major factor in how we navigate society, and for younger women, fictional female characters were often the only other representation of women to look to for guidance. We have talked a lot about gender roles in this class, and one theme that has stuck out to me in particular is how stagnant these gender roles seemed to be in Ancient Greece. Further, it fascinates me how stagnant gender roles have seemed to be in general; I see similarities between gender roles in Ancient Greek society and today. I believe that part of the reason why this is the case is due to the portrayal of women in fictional narratives, leading to lack of strong role models. I think that the recent shifts in gender roles can partially be attributed to stronger female representation in media and fictional narratives.</v-card-text>
            <v-card-text>I want to dive deeper into the way that modern fictional characters have affected women in our society. I plan to interview 5 college students about the impact that female fictional characters have impacted their self-development and self-perception. I hope to examine the impact that both positively portrayed and negatively portrayed female characters have had on these women. I am choosing to interview college-age female students partially because they are the most easily accessible to me for interviews, but also because college students are still in a period of massive self-development. I think it is most interesting to examine the way that female characters impact still-developing young women because this is the critical period for when the impact that these characters can have is the most meaningful.</v-card-text>
            <v-card-text>I want to examine the characteristics and portrayal of both stronger and weaker female characters throughout our past readings. For example, I plan to analyze Lysistrata as an example of how powerful women were characterized. An example of a weaker female character is Ismene from Antigone. I hope to uncover the characteristics that are most impactful and memorable to the women that I interviewed and see the similarities and differences between the characters from the ancient works and modern female characters. I also want to study the reverse side of this, in that I want to see how negative representations of modern female characters have affected the women that I interview.</v-card-text>
