        >Based on the best-selling novel by Margaret Atwood, this series is set in Gilead, a totalitarian society in what used to be part of the United States. Gilead is ruled by a fundamentalist regime that treats women as property of the state, and is faced with environmental disasters and a plummeting birth rate. In a desperate attempt to repopulate a devastated world, the few remaining fertile women are forced into sexual servitude. One of these women, Offred, is determined to survive the terrifying world she lives in, and find the daughter that was taken from her.</p>

              <b>OFFRED (V.O.):</b>
              We go everywhere in twos. This is supposed to be for our protection, but that’s bullshit. The truth is we’re watching each other for any whiff of heresy. She is my spy, as I am hers. She has never said anything that was not strictly orthodox. But then neither have I. She may be a true believer, a Handmaid in more than name. I can’t take that risk. I can’t end up on the Wall and leave my daughter here. Alone.

                      >This is one of the passages that I most enjoyed reading during this class. It was refreshing to see a female character that defied gender stereotypes and stood up for what she believed in. I empathize with Antigone because I relate to her experience combatting stereotypes. However, I do find it somewhat difficult to relate with Antigone because of the extreme circumstances of the passage. Her situation is not necessarily directly relatable to me, but her experience is.</p>

I also find it interesting that she embodies characteristics that were typically attributed to men, such as courage and loyalty. I really respect that she stands up for her beliefs and acts in a way that she believes to be morally right.</p>

She believes that they “are women, not meant to wage war with men,” feeling the need to follow every law no matter her own beliefs on the situation.</p>

                      >Yes, absolutely! I think that the story would lose some of its meaning if it were to be played by all men. There is a clear power dynamic in Antigone between the women and the men of the story, and if it the play were to be all men, the power dynamic would seem to be equal.</p>
